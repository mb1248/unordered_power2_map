The unordered_map from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) use prime numbers for the buckets and therefore a division to
determine the bucket.
While the internal header files provides structs using power 2 buckets, that can distinguish the buckets by a simple
mask operation.

This test changes the typedefs __u2map_hashtable
